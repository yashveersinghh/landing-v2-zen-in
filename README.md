This is my second project with html and css. 

I referenced a website on pinterest and made it entirely on my own, adapting to my own style and theme as well.
With this project, I exposed myself to further complicated css

Overall still a pretty simple project but just more time spent on. Next project I will look forward to making a responsive website, this site kinda wacky when you start to change dimensions
