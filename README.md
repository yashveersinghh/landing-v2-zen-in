This is my **second project** using just **HTML** and **CSS**, where I recreated a clean portfolio-style landing page based on a design I found on **Pinterest**.

---

## ✨ What’s Inside

- Static landing page layout
- Minimal design focus
- Basic responsiveness (but not fully responsive)

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3

> 📌 This was a valuable learning experience in building from a reference and translating design into code, even with basic tools.
